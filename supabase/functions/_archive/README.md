Archived Relevance-related Edge Functions

The following functions were removed as part of the migration to n8n/payload-based workflows:

- forward-to-relevance
- simple-relevance-test
- test-relevance-with-report-id (config entries only)
- career-sections-completed (unused)

Reason: Replaced by `forward-to-n8n` and n8n Payload webhooks. See `supabase/config.toml` for current functions.
