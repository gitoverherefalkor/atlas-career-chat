## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Sjoerd, you are a visionary adapter who thrives in innovative environments where you can exercise autonomy and creativity. With extensive experience in AI and tech startups, you excel at embracing change and envisioning new possibilities, particularly in project-based work where you're trusted to determine your own approach. Your entrepreneurial mindset, combined with your technical expertise in AI agentic workflows and business applications, positions you uniquely for roles that blend technological innovation with strategic oversight—aligning with your aspirations to gain diverse experience while maintaining the job satisfaction you value.

Your career advancement may be hindered by perfectionism and taking on excessive responsibility, which impacts your work-life balance—a priority you've clearly identified. Developing leadership and delegation skills will be crucial for achieving your long-term goal of running a successful business while maintaining personal autonomy. By addressing these challenges and building on your comfort with risk and change, you can create a career path that balances your entrepreneurial ambitions with your need for stability and work-life harmony, particularly as you navigate financial considerations that currently constrain your options.

## PERSONALITY AND TEAM DYNAMICS

Sjoerd, your profile reveals a fascinating blend of visionary thinking and adaptability that shapes how you interact with teams. As someone who "embraces the unknown as a chance to innovate" while maintaining a direct communication style, you create an environment where creative solutions can flourish without losing focus on objectives. This combination is particularly valuable in the AI and tech startup space where you've built your expertise, as these fields require both imaginative thinking and practical implementation.

Your preference for actively engaging in discussions while valuing recognition of individual contributions suggests you thrive in collaborative environments that still honor personal achievement. This balance becomes especially important as you navigate your transition from entrepreneurship to potentially employed roles, where team dynamics may differ significantly from what you've experienced as a founder or consultant.

Your challenge with delegation and trusting team members to complete tasks presents an interesting paradox when paired with your stated preference for a leadership style that delegates autonomy. This tension likely stems from your perfectionist tendencies rather than a fundamental distrust of others' capabilities. Consider implementing a "progressive trust framework" where you gradually increase delegation based on demonstrated competence, starting with smaller tasks and building to more significant responsibilities. This structured approach aligns with your preference for planning ahead while addressing your perfectionism.

Your ability to address disagreements directly while maintaining a focus on securing the best outcome for your team represents a valuable leadership quality. However, to maximize this strength, experiment with "perspective rotation sessions" where team members are asked to articulate viewpoints different from their own. This approach leverages your direct communication style while creating space for the diverse thinking that drives innovation in the AI and tech spaces where you excel.

As you pursue leadership development, focus on transforming your adaptability from an individual strength into a team capability. Your comfort with change and quick adjustment can become a competitive advantage for entire organizations when systematically shared through mentoring and process design. This approach not only addresses your interest in leadership development but also creates a multiplier effect for your natural strengths.

## YOUR STRENGTHS

Your profile highlights two exceptional strengths: being "The Adapter" who thrives amid change and "The Visionary" who envisions new possibilities. This powerful combination has served you well in the AI and tech startup ecosystem, enabling you to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape while maintaining a forward-looking perspective. Your creation of an AI agent for personality assessment demonstrates how you've already leveraged these strengths to produce innovative solutions that blend technical expertise with creative thinking.

Your comfort with risk, quick decision-making, and big-picture focus creates a leadership profile particularly suited to entrepreneurial and innovation-focused environments. These attributes allow you to see opportunities others might miss and move decisively to capture them—a valuable capability in both startup environments and established organizations seeking transformation.

To further leverage these strengths, consider developing what I call "vision-to-execution frameworks" that translate your big-picture ideas into structured implementation plans. These frameworks would bridge the gap between your visionary thinking and the practical execution needed to bring ideas to life, while accommodating your preference for project-based deadlines. Such frameworks could become valuable intellectual property that distinguishes you in leadership roles, particularly as you seek to gain experience in different industries or positions.

Your extensive familiarity with AI presents a unique opportunity to position yourself at the intersection of technological innovation and strategic leadership. Rather than viewing your AI expertise as merely technical knowledge, reframe it as a strategic lens through which you can help organizations envision and implement transformative change. This approach aligns with your interest in innovative environments while creating pathways to the leadership roles you're seeking to develop.

Consider creating "innovation sandboxes" within your current or future roles—designated spaces where you can apply your visionary thinking and adaptability to experiment with new approaches or technologies. These controlled environments allow you to demonstrate your strengths while managing the perfectionism that might otherwise delay implementation. By establishing clear boundaries and success metrics for these experiments, you create opportunities to showcase your capabilities while building the case for larger initiatives.

## OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH

Your identified challenges around perfectionism, taking on excessive responsibility, and being overly critical create a constellation of related issues that may be hindering your career progression and work-life balance. These tendencies, while stemming from high standards and commitment to quality, can create bottlenecks in your effectiveness and limit your ability to scale your impact through others—a critical consideration given your interest in leadership development.

The tension between your work-life balance constraints and your entrepreneurial ambitions requires careful navigation. Your high rating of work-life balance as "very important" suggests this isn't an area where you're willing to compromise, yet your long-term goals of running a successful business and achieving career autonomy often demand significant time investment, at least initially.

To address your perfectionism and tendency to take on too much, implement a "strategic imperfection protocol"—a systematic approach to identifying where excellence is truly required versus where good enough will suffice. This might include categorizing tasks based on their strategic importance and visibility, then deliberately applying different quality standards to each category. This structured approach aligns with your planning preferences while creating space for the delegation necessary in leadership roles.

Your interest in developing leadership and team management skills presents an opportunity to transform your relationship with delegation. Rather than viewing delegation as simply offloading tasks, reframe it as a strategic leadership function that develops others while expanding your impact. Create a "delegation development matrix" that matches team members' growth needs with appropriate challenges, allowing you to systematically build both their capabilities and your trust in their execution.

The financial limitations you've identified as a barrier might benefit from creative approaches that leverage your entrepreneurial mindset. Consider developing "parallel value streams"—complementary professional activities that generate additional income while enhancing your primary career path. These might include consulting, creating digital products related to your AI expertise, or developing intellectual property that can be monetized. This approach addresses financial constraints while maintaining the work-life balance you value highly.

## YOUR (CAREER) VALUES

Your prioritization of job satisfaction, autonomy, and job stability reveals a professional identity centered on meaningful work where you have freedom to operate while maintaining security. This value profile aligns well with your entrepreneurial background and interest in innovative environments, yet also explains your current exploration of employed roles that might offer greater stability without sacrificing the autonomy you cherish.

The relatively lower ranking of accomplishment, recognition, and making an impact is intriguing given your entrepreneurial background, where these elements are often driving motivators. This suggests you're more intrinsically motivated by the work itself and the freedom to approach it on your terms, rather than external validation or broader impact metrics—a perspective that should significantly influence your career choices.

Develop a "values alignment framework" for evaluating potential roles or projects. This framework should explicitly assess how each opportunity contributes to your core values of satisfaction, autonomy, and stability. For example, before pursuing a new position, systematically evaluate not just its compensation and responsibilities, but how it allows for creative freedom, meaningful work, and long-term security. This structured approach leverages your planning preference while ensuring your career moves align with your fundamental values.

Your preference for innovative, forward-thinking company cultures combined with your desire for project-based deadlines suggests you thrive in environments that balance creative freedom with clear objectives. When evaluating opportunities, look specifically for organizations that demonstrate this balance through their project management approaches and innovation processes. The ideal environment for you likely features clear goals and timelines but grants significant autonomy in how those objectives are achieved.

Consider implementing "value-protected time blocks" in your schedule—dedicated periods specifically aligned with your core values. For example, you might reserve time for creative exploration (satisfaction), self-directed projects (autonomy), and long-term planning (stability). By explicitly connecting time allocation to values, you create a practical mechanism for living your priorities daily, which addresses both your work-life balance concerns and your desire for meaningful professional engagement.

  'dream-jobs': `## DREAM JOB ANALYSIS

### Writer

**Feasibility: Moderate to Challenging**

**Alignment with your profile:**
• Your interest in communication and public speaking suggests writing aptitude
• Your experience in strategy could translate to business writing or thought leadership
• Your proudest achievement involves public speaking on mental health, indicating comfort with sharing ideas

**Gaps to address:**
• No mentioned writing experience or portfolio
• Career has been primarily in corporate strategy, not content creation
• Significant income reduction likely (compared to current 150-250K compensation)

**Realistic pathway:**
Start with thought leadership articles on business strategy while maintaining your current role. Build a portfolio through LinkedIn articles, guest posts on industry publications, and potentially a personal blog. Consider writing a book on strategy, leadership, or mental health in the workplace. This creates a foundation for a potential transition to writing later in your career.

### Board Member

**Feasibility: High (Medium-term goal)**

**Alignment with your profile:**
• Executive experience as VP Strategy
• 15+ years of professional experience
• Strong business, strategy, and markets interest
• Long-term goal of reaching senior leadership positions

**Gaps to address:**
• Need to expand network of board connections
• May need broader C-suite experience
• Specific industry expertise may need deepening

**Realistic pathway:**
This is your most attainable dream job. Continue advancing to C-suite roles while seeking board observer roles or non-profit board positions to gain experience. Join organizations like Women on Boards or similar networks. Your technology industry background is valuable for many boards seeking digital transformation expertise. Target board positions in 3-5 years.

### Executive Coach

**Feasibility: Moderate to High**

**Alignment with your profile:**
• Senior leadership experience provides credibility
• Interest in communication, leadership, and team management
• Experience with mental health advocacy suggests empathy
• Desire for work-life balance (coaching can offer flexibility)

**Gaps to address:**
• No mentioned coaching certifications or training
• Need to develop structured coaching methodology
• Building a client base requires networking and marketing

**Realistic pathway:**
Pursue executive coaching certification (ICF, EMCC, etc.) while in your current role. Begin coaching informally within your organization or through mentorship programs. Gradually build a client base through your professional network. This could start as a side business and transition to full-time as you build reputation and clientele.

### Most Realistic Recommendation

Based on your profile, I recommend pursuing **Board Membership** as your primary goal, while developing **Executive Coaching** skills as a complementary path. This combination:

1. Leverages your existing executive experience
2. Aligns with your long-term goals of senior leadership
3. Provides the work-life balance you seek
4. Allows you to utilize your communication skills and interest in leadership
5. Maintains your desired compensation level

A potential role that combines elements of your dream jobs would be a **Chief Strategy Officer with board appointments and mentoring responsibilities**. This would allow you to:
• Exercise strategic thinking
• Serve on boards (internal or external)
• Mentor and develop leaders
• Potentially write thought leadership content
• Maintain executive-level compensation

As per your request for a deeper dive, to make this combination role even more compelling, consider targeting companies with strong Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) commitments. Your strategic thinking can contribute to sustainable business practices, and your mental health advocacy can shape socially responsible policies. In addition, networking within the tech industry, highlighting your strategy experience and board interests, could unveil fractional CSO opportunities that permit board engagements and mentoring, potentially increasing work-life balance.

This approach builds on your strengths while addressing your desire for better work-life balance and confidence development.`
